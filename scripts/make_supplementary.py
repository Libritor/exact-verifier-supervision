"""make_supplementary.py -- build the anonymized ICLR supplementary zip (CPU only, re-runnable).

usage: python scripts/make_supplementary.py [--out ZIP] [--keep-staging] [--no-verify] [--max-mb 60]

What it does
  1. copies code, data, run records, analysis outputs, generations and the preregistration files into a
     fresh staging folder (never touches the repository files themselves);
  2. scrubs the copies: absolute paths (C:\\Users\\..., /home/...) -> repo-relative, commit hashes in
     PREDICTIONS.md and elsewhere -> the paper's neutral labels P1..P6 (other hashes removed), timestamp
     locations -> time zone, names of people / internal packages -> neutral words;
  3. writes README_SUPPLEMENT.md (folder guide, reproduction commands, environment read from the installed
     packages, hardware, preregistration protocol with a hash-free timestamp manifest from git log);
  4. zips the staging folder, then re-opens the zip and scans every member (names and contents, including
     JSONL fields such as adapter paths) case-insensitively for forbidden terms, absolute paths, git metadata
     and commit hashes; exits non-zero if anything remains or the zip exceeds --max-mb;
  5. (unless --no-verify) runs paper/exp/make_numbers.py inside a scratch copy of the staging folder to check
     that the numbers rebuild from the anonymized files alone.

The zip is written to --out (default: ~/Downloads/PerfectLabels_ICLR2027_supplementary.zip).
The scan list below necessarily contains the terms it scans for; this script is NOT copied into the zip.

Anonymized for double-blind review. Absolute paths were made repository-relative, commit hashes were
replaced by the neutral labels P1..P6 used in the paper (other hashes removed), and internal package and
people names were replaced by neutral words. Nothing else was changed; every table and figure in the paper
is regenerated from the files in this folder.

## Folder guide

| path | contents |
|---|---|
| `experiments/` | all experiment and analysis code. Workers: `exp_thinking_ft_worker.py` (prior grid and S1 cells), `exp_worker_v2.py` (all later cells: arms base/A/B/C/B'/D, eval-only controls), `exp_worker_star.py` (arm S: sample K solutions, keep those whose final answer the exact verifier accepts, fine-tune). Queue runners: `run_queue.py`, `run_queue2.py`. Dataset generators: `exp_thinking_dataset.py`, `exp_dataset_v2.py` (fixed seeds), `check_v2.py` (dataset invariants). Analysis: `analysis_common.py` (loaders), `analysis_stats.py` (bootstrap CIs, McNemar, Holm), `analysis_steps.py` (per-step trace parsing, per-step accuracy q), `analysis_rules.py` (shortcut rules), `analysis_probe.py` (surface probe), `analysis_tokens.py`, `analysis_report.py`. `exp_gate_*` and `exp_logic_*`: the earlier answer-only study reported in the appendix. |
| `paper/exp/` | `build_all.py` (one command: analysis -> numbers -> figures -> PDF), `make_numbers.py` (every number in the text is a macro written to `paper/numbers.tex` and `paper/tab_runs.tex`), `make_figures.py`, `make_fig_story.py`, `numbers.json` (each macro with its source). |
| `paper/` | LaTeX source of the submission and the style files needed to build it. |
| `PREDICTIONS.md` | second preregistration (S1..S6) and its append-only decision log (S7..S12, outcomes, corrections). |
| `results/THINKING_VS_DATA.md` | first preregistration (H1..H4, prior grid) with its results appended below it. |
| `results/GATE_FINETUNE*.md`, `results/LOGIC_FINETUNE.md` | write-ups of the earlier answer-only study (appendix table). |
| `results/thinking_vs_data/` | prior-grid dataset (`datasets.json`), B-ext traces (`ornith_traces.jsonl`), prior-grid runs (`runs.jsonl`) and the S1 replication runs (`runs_L1.jsonl`). |
| `results/v2/datasets_v2.json` | all tasks of the main study: train pools per arm and trace format, problem-disjoint 240-item test sets, 4-shot demos. |
| `results/v2/runs_<model>.jsonl` | one row per training run ({len(runs)} files: {", ".join(runs)}). |
| `results/v2/evals_<model>.jsonl` | eval-only rows (zero-shot CoT, 4-shot, transfer to other test sets) ({", ".join(evals)}). |
| `results/v2/gens/<model>/` | saved generations, one row per test item: id, gold, pred, correct, gen, n_gen_tokens, hit_cap. File name `<task>_<arm>_<n>_<seed>[__on-<eval_task>][__<prompt_mode>][__reeval].jsonl`. |
| `results/v2/star_samples/<model>/` | arm S: the K sampled solutions per training item and which were kept by the verifier. |
| `results/v2/sweep/` | S12 answer-only learning-rate/epoch sweep: one file per configuration (`sweepA_<task>_lr<lr>_ep<epochs>.jsonl`, rows carry `lr` and `epochs`) and its generations under `sweep/gens/`; kept out of the main run files so the main analyses never mix them with the default-configuration cells. |
| `results/analysis/` | outputs of the analysis scripts (stats, per-step accuracy, shortcut rules, probe, token counts). |
| `results/queues/`, `results/queue_L1.txt` | the exact cell lists that were run (one cell per line: `<task> <arm> <n> <seed> [worker flags]`). |
| `results/logic_dataset.json` | dataset of the earlier logic study. |

Run records: {n_rows} rows in total. Each row has `task, arm, n, seed, acc, n_test, model` and `bits`, a hex
bitmap of per-item correctness over the fixed test set (item order of `datasets_v2.json`), from which every
paired test (McNemar, bootstrap over items and seeds) is recomputed. `adapter` fields are repo-relative;
the LoRA adapters themselves (several hundred MB) are not included and are re-created by training.

## Reproduce one cell (GPU)

```
# arm B, div7, n = 180, seed 0, Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct; prints RESULT {{json}}, writes generations + adapter
python experiments/exp_worker_v2.py div7 B 180 0 --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct
# eval-only controls
python experiments/exp_worker_v2.py div7 base 0 0 --eval-only none --prompt-mode cot
python experiments/exp_worker_v2.py div7 B 180 0 --eval-only auto --eval-task div7_6d
# arm S (self-generated, verifier-filtered traces; K = 4, temperature 0.7)
python experiments/exp_worker_star.py div7 S 180 0 --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct
# prior grid / S1 worker
python experiments/exp_thinking_ft_worker.py div7 B 180 1
# a whole queue, appended to a run file, resumable (skips cells already present)
python experiments/run_queue2.py results/queues/q4_3b.txt results/v2/runs_Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct.jsonl \\
    --worker exp_worker_v2.py --extra --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct --eval-bs 32
```

The worker loads the model from the Hugging Face cache with `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1` (download the model once
beforehand, or unset the variable). Training: LoRA r = 8, alpha = 16 on q/k/v/o, lr 2e-4, 3 epochs,
batch 1, bf16, prompt tokens masked; decoding greedy. Eval-only rows belong in `evals_<model>.jsonl`, not
in `runs_<model>.jsonl` (see `run_queue2.py`).

## Rebuild every table and figure (CPU only)

```
python paper/exp/build_all.py                 # analysis -> paper/numbers.tex, tab_runs.tex -> figures -> PDF
python paper/exp/build_all.py --skip-analysis # reuse results/analysis/*
# or step by step
python experiments/analysis_stats.py ; python experiments/analysis_steps.py ; python experiments/analysis_rules.py
python paper/exp/make_numbers.py ; python paper/exp/make_figures.py
```

`build_all.py` needs pdflatex and bibtex for the PDF step; the numbers and figures need only the Python
packages below. It exits non-zero on an undefined reference, an unfilled number macro, or a failed step.
The dataset generators for prime/valid used a Z3-based consistency checker from an in-house package that is
not included (its module name was replaced by `exactgate`); the generated datasets are included, so no
regeneration is needed to reproduce any cell.

## Environment

- Python {platform.python_version()} (analysis and paper build), {platform.system()} and Linux
- torch {v["torch"]}, transformers {v["transformers"]}, peft {v["peft"]}, accelerate {v["accelerate"]},
  safetensors {v["safetensors"]}
- analysis: numpy {v["numpy"]}, scipy {v["scipy"]}, scikit-learn {v["scikit-learn"]}, matplotlib {v["matplotlib"]}
- versions read from the installed packages when this folder was built; the RTX 5090 runs pinned the same
  torch / transformers / peft versions (CUDA 12.8 wheels).

## Hardware

- NVIDIA RTX 4060 Laptop GPU (8 GB): Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct cells (the preregistered model) and part of the
  0.5B cells.
- NVIDIA RTX 5090 desktop GPU (32 GB): Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct cells, 0.5B cells, and
  extra seeds.
- Analysis and the paper build run on CPU.

## Preregistration protocol

1. **First preregistration** (`results/THINKING_VS_DATA.md`): written before any run of the prior grid and
   never edited afterwards; results were appended below it. Endpoints H1..H4 (arms A, B, C on prime, valid,
   div7; 240 problem-disjoint test items; paired McNemar, Holm across tasks).
2. **Second preregistration** (`PREDICTIONS.md`): decision rules S1..S6, committed (P1) before any of the
   runs it governs. S1 was a go/no-go replication of the prior div7 result, run first.
3. **Append-only decision log**: each new hypothesis (S7, S8/S9, S10, S11, S12) was committed to the repository
   before any cell it governs had started, and each outcome was logged when its cells finished, including
   every failed prediction (S5, S9, S10, S11) and a post hoc correction of an audit (S10). Earlier entries were never
   rewritten, except that estimated clock times were replaced by the commit times on the day they were written.
4. The commit is the time stamp. Hashes are replaced by labels here; the times below come from the version
   history (author time with UTC offset). P1..P6 are the labels used in the paper's appendix; commits marked
   `-` changed only wording or time stamps, or appended outcome entries written "time = this commit".

{prereg_manifest()}
5. Analyses not named in either file (the surface probe, extended trace re-audit, derived forms of the
   compounding model) are labelled post hoc in the paper.
